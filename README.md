For this challenge we were giving and index.html that worked but needed to be cleaned up so if any issues arise it will be more organized allowing you to solve the issue more quickly.
To do this I went through the code and stared to replace div with the other tags we had learned during our first few lessons. I had to show my knowledge of how to properly use Main, section, aside, and article. I then had to update the style.css sheet and was able to combined different classes and ids together to consolidate the sheet so it was easier to read.
